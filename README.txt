Corner2Speech

This software announces corner names as you drive in iRacing, so that you can
learn the corners as you drive.  It's especially intended for the Nurburgring
Nordschleife (and all of its variants) which is ordinarily difficult to learn.

To run the software
    You must have Python installed...
        Go to the Microsoft Store
        Find "Python 3.11" (or similar) and install it
    Download a ZIP file from GitHub...
        Click on the Green "Code" button
        Click on "Download ZIP"
        Expand the ZIP somewhere
    Run the program...
        Double click on the Corner2Speech.py file
        It might need to install something the first time you run it
        Just run it again if it did need to do an install
        Corner2Speech will just sit there and wait until iRacing starts up
